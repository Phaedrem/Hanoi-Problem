# Hanoi-Problem

The Tower of Hanoi is a classic puzzle involving three pegs and a number of disks of varying sizes. The disks start on one peg, stacked in descending order of size (largest at the bottom). The objective is to move the entire stack to another peg while following these rules:

One disk at a time: Only one disk may be moved in a single move.
Larger disks cannot be placed on smaller ones: You can only place a disk on top of a larger disk or on an empty peg.
Use of an auxiliary peg: The third peg is used to help with the transfers.

This code employs a recurive algorithm to solve the Tower of Hanoi problem and provide the minimum number of moves required.
